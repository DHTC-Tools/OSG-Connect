Files to add to /usr/bin to hosts with 
HTCondor 7.9 or
HTCondor 8.0

HTCondor 8.1 should have an updated version of these scripts
and requires no password authentication (different file transfer 
mechanism using ssh tunneling and token)

These BOSCO changes will go in HTCondor 8.1 and not be retrofitted in 7.9.
Probably not even 8.0
The script should be added in /usr/bin and the configuration file is an example of
what could go in /etc/condor/config.d
